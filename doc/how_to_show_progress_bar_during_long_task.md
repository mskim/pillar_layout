# How can I show progress bar while some progress is going on?

I am trying to show progress-bar during change_template, which takes some time.

There seems to be several ways to do it.

1. progrress_job gem with delayed_job

1. using css and JavaScript

1. using boostrap progress-bar and JavaScript

```
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-success" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="57%" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="57">

```
