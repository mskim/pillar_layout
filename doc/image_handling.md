# image handling

We will use carrierwave gem to handle images.
We should have three carrierwave image uploaders in Issue model.
issue_images, issue_ads, issue_graphics

images should be in  page_story.ext format, where page is page number and story is story number.

Once they are uploaded they can be placed automatically into articles.
by assigning them woking_articles_id.

Or they can be uploaded from working_article_edit window.

##TODO remove or rename identifiers?
