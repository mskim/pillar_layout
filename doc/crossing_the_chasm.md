## How can we deal with current editors

1. They will be the first on to go.
2. What if they become our sales force and A/S partner.
  - counter propose to the newspaper
  - Set up separate service unit
  - cut the cost into 1/2
      by reducing the space
      - work at home
      - maintain service

## As a result
  - we don't have to  fight with current work force
  - all can win win and be happy in theory.

  - we can still achieve our target income of getting 1/5 as our income
  - owners can still cut the cost in 1/2
  - current workers can keep their source of income, might be less but maintain the income rather than lose all.
